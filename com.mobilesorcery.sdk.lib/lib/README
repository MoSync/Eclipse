The jna.jar currently contains a modified version of NativeLibrary.java, since
the latest released version did not read jna.library.path after the first library
was loaded. This is fixed in the trunk of JNA, but there is currently no release
that contains the fix, and the latest trunk version does not build. When the 
next version is released it should replace the current jna.jar.

Current version: 3.2.5
JNA SVN revision that fixes the bug: 1088

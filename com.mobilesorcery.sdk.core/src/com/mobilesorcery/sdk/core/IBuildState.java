/**
 * <p>An auxiliary class for handling build state across hundreds
 * of different devices.</p>
 * <p>Since Eclipse natively only supports one delta state per
 * builder, we need to augment this to one build state per
 * <code>IBuildVariant</code>. (Note: several build variants
 * may actually share output location -- it is up to clients
 * to compare which build variant this object represents with
 * the variant actually built.)</p>
 * <p>Clients may call this class to store and load build state
 * to extract build deltas on a per-buildvariant basis.</p>
 * <p>The information persisted by this class includes the
 * entire file tree used during building with it's timestamp;
 * this will limit the need for file traversal as well as gracefully
 * handling deleted files.</p>
 * <p>Also, the contents of the file is not meant to be used for long-term storage,
 * it's just there to temporarily aid the dependency analysis.</p>
